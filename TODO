- Fix memory leak in StaticRoute (print-requests)
- Split hpack into its own repo & submodule it in as a dependency like fb64.
- Remove `Routes*` from `ServerTransport`s.
- Handle backend connection/request failure!
- Catch exception in handler without killing server.
- Prevent pipelining (or ensure it's handled safely; eg. a queue) rather than
  probably starting on a new request before the previous one completes.
- Replace epollFD() calls in proxy w/ Events type.
  And possibly a default thread-local instance.
- Multiprocess/multithread.
- HTTP client (like curl).
